      ✅ PR-1 BACKEND SMOKE TEST COMPLETED - ALL TESTS PASSED (2026-03-06)
      
      Performed comprehensive backend smoke test validating PR-1 auth/config hardening deployment.
      
      Test Results (Base URL: https://dashboard-stabilize.preview.emergentagent.com):
      1. ✅ POST /api/auth/login - PASSED (200 OK, access_token + refresh_token received)

      5. ✅ 5xx Error Check - PASSED (No server errors detected)
      
      PR-1 Auth Hardening Validation:
      ✅ Webhook security working correctly - rejects requests when STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET not configured
      ✅ Returns proper 503 status with webhook_secret_missing error code
      ✅ No auth regression detected in login/token flows
      ✅ No JSON shape corruption or format breaking

      3. ✅ Auth regression test (/api/auth/me + /api/admin/agencies) - PASSED (both endpoints working correctly)
      4. ✅ POST /api/auth/refresh (rotation) - PASSED (200 OK, access_token rotated ✅, refresh_token rotated ✅)
      5. ✅ Refresh token reuse prevention - PASSED (401 status, old refresh token properly rejected)
      6. ✅ POST /api/auth/revoke-all-sessions - PASSED (200 OK, token invalidated after revoke-all-sessions)
      7. ✅ 5xx and JSON shape validation - PASSED (no 5xx errors or JSON parsing issues detected)

      ✅ Sessions endpoint working - can list active sessions
      ✅ Refresh token rotation working correctly - both tokens rotate
      ✅ Refresh token reuse prevention working - old tokens rejected with 401
      ✅ Session revocation working - revoke-all-sessions invalidates tokens
      ✅ No auth regression detected in core endpoints
      ✅ No server errors or JSON corruption detected
      ✅ Rate limiting properly configured (300s retry window)
      
      Conclusion:
      PR-2 session/revocation hardening deployment is successful. All session management features are working correctly and no regressions detected. The session model enhancements are functioning as designed.
