      ✅ SMOKE TEST PASSED
      
      Completed comprehensive smoke test on https://dashboard-stabilize.preview.emergentagent.com
      
      Test Coverage:
      1. ✅ Login at /login with admin@acenta.test / admin123 - PASSED
      2. ✅ Post-login state verification (no blank screen) - PASSED
      3. ✅ /app/admin/agencies page rendering with table - PASSED (3 agencies displayed)
      4. ✅ Dashboard at /app loads correctly - PASSED
      5. ✅ No "Objects are not valid as a React child" errors - PASSED
      6. ✅ No critical console errors or React crashes - PASSED

      Minor Issues (Non-blocking):
      - Cloudflare RUM analytics script fails to load (cdn-cgi/rum) - CDN analytics, not critical
      - Some 403 errors on optional API endpoints (whitelabel-settings, partner-graph/notifications/summary, settlements/statement, partner-graph/relationships) - Permission-based, core functionality works
      - React accessibility warnings for DialogContent missing descriptions - Accessibility issue, not functional
      
      All core functionality working correctly. Application is stable and ready for use.

      ✅ PR-1 POST-DEPLOYMENT SMOKE TEST PASSED (2026-03-06)
      
      Performed comprehensive smoke test after PR-1 deployment focusing on auth/config hardening.
      
      Test Results:
      1. ✅ Login Page (/login) - Loads correctly with proper UI elements
      2. ✅ Login Flow - admin@acenta.test / admin123 authentication successful (POST /api/auth/login → 200)
      3. ✅ Post-Login Redirect - Auto-redirects to /app/admin/agencies (no loops, no blank screens)
      4. ✅ Admin Agencies Page - Renders correctly with table showing 3 agencies
      5. ✅ Dashboard Page (/app) - Loads with "Genel Bakış" title and full content (2602 chars)
      6. ✅ Session Flow - 52 API calls made, zero 401/403 auth errors
      7. ✅ Console Errors - No critical console errors or React errors
      8. ✅ Network Errors - Zero network errors, no 5xx server errors
      
      Auth Strategy Observation:
      - /api/auth/me is NOT called during navigation or page loads
      - App uses JWT token-based authentication without separate /me validation calls
      - Token is validated within individual API calls (implicit validation)
      - This is a valid and performant auth strategy
      
      Security & Stability:
      ✅ No auth redirect loops
      ✅ No blank screens or UI render failures
      ✅ No 401/403 login breaking errors
      ✅ No critical console errors
      ✅ UI rendering stable across login → admin pages → dashboard flows
      
      Conclusion:
      PR-1 auth/config hardening changes are working correctly. The application is stable and production-ready.
