# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
# ## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
# ## backend:
# ##   - task: "Task name"
# ##     implemented: true
# ##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
# ##     file: "file_path.py"
# ##     stuck_count: 0
# ##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
# ##     needs_retesting: true
# ##     status_history:
# ##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
# ##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
# ##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"

# ##   test_all: false
# ##   test_priority: "high_first"  # or "sequential" or "stuck_first"
#
# Incorporate User Feedback:
# When the user provides feedback on test results or identifies issues:
# 1. Update the status_history with the user's feedback
# 2. If the user marks something as not working, set needs_retesting: true
# 3. Prioritize fixing issues identified by the user

The modal correctly displays items that will be shown/hidden, and all mode transitions work smoothly. However, the sidebar filtering is still broken - even though mode switches work correctly and API returns proper data, the sidebar continues to show all navigation groups regardless of current mode. Route guard also has issues (enterprise-only routes accessible in Lite mode). Focus should be on fixing the sidebar filtering logic in AppShell.jsx."

After thorough testing, I can confirm that the correct navigation groups show/hide based on the active product mode. In Lite mode, only CORE, CRM, FİNANS, and YÖNETİM groups are visible (B2B AĞ, OPS, and ENTERPRISE are correctly hidden). In Pro mode, B2B AĞ and OPS become visible while ENTERPRISE remains hidden. In Enterprise mode, all 7 groups are visible. The only remaining issue is the route guard - enterprise-only routes (like /app/admin/branding) are still accessible in Lite mode, which is a security concern that should be addressed."
