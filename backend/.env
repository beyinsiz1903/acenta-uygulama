# Backend env file for Emergent deployment
# NOTE: Real secrets (MONGO_URL, DB credentials, JWT_SECRET, etc.)
# are provided by Emergent via environment variables / secrets.
# This file is intentionally kept free of sensitive values and
# only exists so deployment tooling (MANAGE_SECRETS) can read it
# without failing with "no such file or directory".

# You MAY define additional non-sensitive defaults here for local/dev use,
# but production/preview should rely on platform-managed env vars.
