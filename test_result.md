      ✅ PR-1 BACKEND SMOKE TEST COMPLETED - ALL TESTS PASSED (2026-03-06)
      
      Performed comprehensive backend smoke test validating PR-1 auth/config hardening deployment.
      
      Test Results (Base URL: https://dashboard-stabilize.preview.emergentagent.com):
      1. ✅ POST /api/auth/login - PASSED (200 OK, access_token + refresh_token received)
      2. ✅ GET /api/auth/me - PASSED (200 OK, user data returned with Bearer token)

      5. ✅ 5xx Error Check - PASSED (No server errors detected)
      
      PR-1 Auth Hardening Validation:
      ✅ Webhook security working correctly - rejects requests when STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET not configured
      ✅ Returns proper 503 status with webhook_secret_missing error code
      ✅ No auth regression detected in login/token flows
      ✅ No JSON shape corruption or format breaking
      ✅ All critical endpoints stable and secure
      
      Conclusion:
      PR-1 auth/config hardening deployment is successful. All security measures are working correctly and no regressions detected. The webhook endpoint properly enforces secret validation as required.
